# Building My Brand - Technical Portfolio

This section outlines strategies for building your technical portfolio, leveraging Git and GitHub to showcase your skills, and achieving your career goals.

---

## **Career Goals**
1. **Formulate Clear Career Goals**:
   - Define short-term and long-term goals. For example:
     - Short-term: Complete a Python bootcamp and build 3 portfolio projects.
     - Long-term: Land a role as a software developer or data analyst.
   - Write down your goals and revisit them regularly to track progress.

2. **Collaborate Effectively**:
   - Use Git and GitHub to collaborate with peers, clients, and employers.
   - Practice working in teams by contributing to open-source projects or group coding challenges.

3. **Store and Restore Versions of Your Work**:
   - Use Git to track changes in your projects, ensuring you can always revert to a previous version if needed.
   - Regularly commit your work with meaningful messages to maintain a clear history.

---

## **Git Components**
1. **Working Directory**:
   - The folder on your computer where you make changes to files.
   - Example: Editing a Python script (`script.py`) in your project folder.

2. **Staging Area**:
   - A temporary area where you prepare changes for committing.
   - Example: Use `git add script.py` to stage changes before committing.

3. **Git Repository**:
   - The database where Git stores all versions of your project.
   - Example: After committing, your changes are saved in the repository.

---

## **File States in Git**
1. **Committed**:
   - Files are safely stored in the repository.
   - Example: After running `git commit`, your changes are saved.

2. **Modified**:
   - Files have been changed in the working directory but not yet staged.
   - Example: You edited `script.py` but havenâ€™t run `git add` yet.

3. **Staged**:
   - Files are marked to be included in the next commit.
   - Example: After running `git add script.py`, the file is staged.

---

## **Git Workflow**
1. Modify files in the **working directory**.
2. Add modified files to the **staging area** using `git add`.
3. Commit changes from the staging area to the **Git repository** using `git commit`.

---

## **Sharing Code**
- Use Git to share code that demonstrates your skills with peers, clients, and employers.
- Utilize **local** and **remote** repositories (e.g., GitHub) to collaborate and showcase your work.

---

## **Local Repositories**
1. **Initialize a Repository**:
   - Use `git init` to create a new Git repository in your project directory.
   - Example: Run `git init` in your project folder to start version control.

2. **Add Files**:
   - Use `git add <file>` to add new or modified files to the staging area.
   - Example: `git add script.py` stages the file for commit.

3. **Tracked vs. Untracked Files**:
   - **Tracked**: Files in the last snapshot.
   - **Untracked**: Files not yet tracked by Git.
   - Example: New files are untracked until you run `git add`.

4. **Check Status**:
   - Use `git status` to see the state of your files.
   - Example: `git status` shows which files are staged, modified, or untracked.

---

## **Committing Changes**
1. Add files to the staging area with `git add`.
2. Commit changes with `git commit -m "commit message"`.
3. View commit history with `git log`.

---

## **Customizing Git Log**
- Use `git log --pretty=oneline` to display commit history in a concise format.
- Example: `git log --pretty=oneline` shows each commit on a single line.

---

## **Syncing Local & Remote Repositories**
1. **Authenticate Git with GitHub**:
   - Use the GitHub CLI to log in and authenticate.
   - Example: Run `gh auth login` to authenticate.

2. **Push to Remote Repository**:
   - Use `git remote add origin <repository-url>` to link your local repository to a remote one.
   - Push changes with `git push origin <branch>`.
   - Example: `git push origin main` uploads your local changes to GitHub.

---

## **Git Setup**
- Configure Git with your name and email:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  git config --global color.ui auto
  ```

---

## **Essential Git Commands**
### **Setup & Initialization**
- `git init`: Initialize a directory as a Git repository.
- `git clone <url>`: Clone a repository from a remote URL.

### **Staging & Snapshot**
- `git status`: Show modified files.
- `git add <file>`: Stage a file for commit.
- `git reset <file>`: Unstage a file.
- `git diff`: Show changes not yet staged.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit staged changes.

### **Branching & Merging**
- `git branch`: List branches.
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch to a branch.
- `git merge <branch>`: Merge a branch into the current one.

### **Inspecting & Comparing**
- `git log`: Show commit history.
- `git diff <branchA>..<branchB>`: Compare branches.

### **Sharing & Updating**
- `git remote add <alias> <url>`: Add a remote repository.
- `git push <alias> <branch>`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

---

## **Branching**
- Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create and switch to a new branch.
- Merge branches with `git merge`.

---

## **Stashing Changes**
- Use `git stash` to temporarily save changes.
- Restore stashed changes with `git stash pop`.

---

## **Ignoring Files**
- Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude files from being tracked.
- Example: Add `*.log` to ignore log files.

---

## **Pull Requests (PRs)**
1. Create a branch for your changes.
2. Commit and push your changes.
3. Open a PR on GitHub for code review.
4. Merge the PR after approval.

---

## **README Files**
- Use `README.md` to describe your project.
- Include:
  - Project name and description.
  - Installation instructions.
  - Usage examples.
  - Credits and acknowledgments.
