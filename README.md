## About Me
Hi, I’m **Gower Campbell**, a creative professional transitioning from filmmaking to tech. With a background in multimedia and post-production, I’ve honed skills in collaboration, project management, and technical creativity. My passion for storytelling has led me to explore how programming can enhance film and media.

While working as a production assistant and earning a Master’s degree, I realized that technology, especially programming, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of visual media. As a freelance video editor, I encourage everyone to learn programming languages like JavaScript to create more interactive and modern content. Currently, I’m focusing on Python for its power in data management and application development with Django.

I’m currently enrolled in a 16-week bootcamp to sharpen my skills in software development and data analysis. I’m excited to blend my creative background with my growing technical abilities to make an impact in this tech-driven media world.
